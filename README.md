## Overview

This repository focuses on the quality assurance of the Todo List App by automating the testing process using Cypress. The goal is to ensure that the most critical functionalities of the application are thoroughly tested and validated. The test cases have been carefully selected based on their relevance to the core user interactions within the app.

## Setup

To run the Cypress tests locally, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. If you haven't already installed these, you can download them from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Test-Todo-list-app-with-Cypress.io
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd cypress
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Tests

After setting up the project, you can run the Cypress tests using the following commands:

### Run Tests in Interactive Mode

Cypress has an interactive mode where you can see your tests running in real-time:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

This will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can select and run the tests located under the `cypress/e2e` directory.

### Run Tests in Headless Mode

To run the tests in headless mode, which is useful for CI/CD pipelines or quick local testing, use the following command:

```bash
npx cypress run
```

## Test Structure

The test cases are organized within the `cypress/e2e/` directory, specifically in the `3-test-cases-test-cases.cy.js` file. This file contains the three most relevant test cases that validate the key functionalities of the Todo List App:

1. **Adding a New Todo Item**
   - Verifies that a user can successfully add a new todo item to the list.

2. **Marking a Todo Item as Completed**
   - Ensures that a user can mark a todo item as completed and that the UI updates accordingly.

3. **Deleting a Todo Item**
   - Checks that a user can delete a todo item and that it is removed from the list.

## Key Considerations

- **Test Reliability:** The tests are designed to be reliable and repeatable, ensuring consistent results as long as the application functions correctly.
- **Ease of Use:** The tests are written to be easily understandable and modifiable, allowing for quick adjustments or expansions as the application evolves.
- **Coverage:** While the focus is on key functionalities, the structure allows for easy addition of further test cases to cover more of the application's features.
- **Quality Assurance:** The selected tests represent the most critical interactions from a user perspective, ensuring that the most valuable parts of the application are tested first.
