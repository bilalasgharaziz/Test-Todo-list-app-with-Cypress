Overview
This repository focuses on the quality assurance of the Todo List App by automating the testing process using Cypress. The goal is to ensure that the most critical functionalities of the application are thoroughly tested and validated. The test cases have been carefully selected based on their relevance to the core user interactions within the app.

Setup
To run the Cypress tests locally, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. If you haven't already installed these, you can download them from Node.js.

Installation Steps
Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Test-Todo-list-app-with-Cypress.io

Navigate to the Project Directory

cd cypress

Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

npm install

Running the Tests
After setting up the project, you can run the Cypress tests using the following commands:

Run Tests in Interactive Mode
Cypress has an interactive mode where you can see your tests running in real-time:

npx cypress open

This will open the Cypress Test Runner, where you can select and run the tests located under the cypress/e2e directory.

Run Tests in Headless Mode
To run the tests in headless mode, which is useful for CI/CD pipelines or quick local testing, use the following command:

npx cypress run

Test Structure

The test cases are organized within the cypress/e2e/ directory, specifically in the 3-test-cases-test-cases.cy.js file. This file contains the three most relevant test cases that validate the key functionalities of the Todo List App:

Adding a New Todo Item
Verifies that a user can successfully add a new todo item to the list.
Marking a Todo Item as Completed
Ensures that a user can mark a todo item as completed and that the UI updates accordingly.
Deleting a Todo Item
Checks that a user can delete a todo item and that it is removed from the list.
